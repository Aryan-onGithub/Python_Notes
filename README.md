# Python_Notes
these are my personal notes for python, which are written in the code itself inside comments
1. you can find all the notes inside the python notes folder
2. notes are in .py files
3. ignore other files as they were created to test code
4. their are two other files you can read:
   1. pycharm shortcuts
   2. some text notes
